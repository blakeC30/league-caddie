"""
League and LeagueMember models.

A League is an independent fantasy golf group. Multiple leagues can exist on
the platform simultaneously — each has its own members, seasons, and standings.

LeagueMember is the join table between User and League. It also stores the
user's role and membership status:
  - role:   "manager" | "member"
  - status: "pending" (awaiting manager approval) | "approved" (active member)

Joining a private league creates a "pending" membership. The league manager then
approves or denies via the /leagues/{league_id}/requests endpoints. Public leagues
(is_public=True) auto-approve on join — but all leagues are currently created
as private; the is_public field exists for future use.

Invite flow: each league has a unique invite_code (random 22-char URL-safe
string). League managers share this code as a join link: /join/{invite_code}.
The code doesn't change unless the manager explicitly regenerates it.
