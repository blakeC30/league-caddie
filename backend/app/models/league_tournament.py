"""
LeagueTournament model — join table between leagues and tournaments.

A league admin selects which PGA Tour tournaments their league will
participate in. This handles two common scenarios:
  1. Multiple events in one week — the admin picks which event counts.
  2. Mid-season start — tournaments before the league started are excluded.

Picks and standings are scoped to a league's selected tournaments only.
Playoff rounds are automatically determined as the last N scheduled tournaments
in the league's schedule (N = required rounds for the configured playoff_size).
