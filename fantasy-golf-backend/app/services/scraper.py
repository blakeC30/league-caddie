"""
PGA Tour data scraper using the ESPN unofficial sports API.

Why ESPN? It requires no API key, has been stable for years, and returns
JSON — no HTML scraping needed. The downside is it's unofficial and
undocumented, so the response shape can change without notice. All
parsing is written defensively (.get() everywhere, sensible defaults).

Architecture
------------
The functions here are split into two clear layers:

  1. Parsing (pure functions):
     parse_schedule_response() takes the scoreboard JSON and returns clean
     tournament dicts. No DB access, so it's trivial to unit test.

  2. Database (upsert functions):
     upsert_tournaments(), upsert_field(), score_picks() take parsed dicts
     and write to the DB using SQLAlchemy sessions.

High-level orchestration functions (sync_schedule, sync_tournament,
full_sync) combine both layers and are what the scheduler and admin
endpoint call.

ESPN API endpoints used
-----------------------
  Schedule:  https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/golf/pga/scoreboard
             ?dates={YYYY}  → all events for that calendar year

  Core API:  https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/golf/leagues/pga/...
             /events/{id}/competitions/{competition_id}/competitors?limit=200
               → all golfers/teams in the field with finish order
             /competitions/{competition_id}/competitors/{team_id}/roster
               → individual athlete IDs for a team competitor (team events only)
             /events/{id}/competitions/{competition_id}/competitors/{competitor_id}/statistics
               → earnings for completed tournaments; team events use 'officialAmount'
               stat (divided by 2 for per-golfer share); individual events use 'amount'
             /events/{id}/competitions/{competition_id}/competitors/{competitor_id}/linescores
               → per-round data for each golfer: tee time, strokes, score-to-par,
               leaderboard position, and playoff flag. One call returns ALL rounds
               played so far, replacing the older /status endpoint (which only
               returned the current round's tee time). Stored in tournament_entry_rounds.
             /athletes/{athlete_id}
               → golfer name and country

  NOTE: For most tournaments, competition_id == pga_tour_id (event ID).
  Team-format events (e.g. Zurich Classic) use a DIFFERENT competition_id
  exposed in the scoreboard as competitions[0].id. The scraper stores this
  in Tournament.competition_id so subsequent calls use the correct ID.

Per-round data notes
--------------------
  The /linescores endpoint returns a paginated list of round objects for a
  competitor. Each item includes:
    period         → round number (1–4 regular, 5+ playoff)
    teeTime        → ISO 8601 UTC string for that round's start time
    value          → total strokes for the round (float, cast to int)
    displayValue   → score-to-par as string ("-2", "E", "+1") — parsed to int
    currentPosition→ leaderboard rank after this round (integer, stored as string)
    isPlayoff      → true for playoff rounds

  Tee times are only released Tuesday or Wednesday before the Thursday start.
  When linescores are empty or teeTime is absent, we store None and leave
  picks unlocked.

  tournament_entries.tee_time always holds Round 1's tee time and is never
  overwritten by later rounds. Pick-locking logic reads this field: once Round 1
  has started (tee_time <= now), the pick is locked for the entire tournament.

Note: The older summary endpoint (site.api.espn.com/...pga/summary?event=)
is no longer functional — it returns ESPN error code 2500 for all event IDs.
The core API endpoints above are the reliable replacement.
