"""
APScheduler background job scheduler — scraper container only.

This module is imported by app/scraper_main.py (the scraper container
entrypoint). It is NOT imported by app/main.py — the API container runs
without a scheduler. Keeping them separate means scraper failures cannot
take down the API, and the two containers can be deployed independently.

Jobs
----
  schedule_sync       (daily at 06:00 UTC)
    Fetches the full PGA Tour season schedule and upserts tournaments.
    Always runs — status transitions, rescheduling, and cancellations need
    to be reflected promptly. Publishes TOURNAMENT_COMPLETED SQS events for
    any tournament that transitions to "completed" in this sync.

  field_sync_d2       (daily at 14:00 UTC)
    Syncs the field for any tournament starting in exactly 2 days (fields
    are typically announced Mon–Tue, 2 days before the Thursday start).
    Anchored to start_date, not a fixed weekday, so non-Thursday starts
    (alternate events, rain-delayed reschedules) are handled correctly.

  field_sync_d1       (daily at 18:00 UTC)
    Syncs the field for any tournament starting tomorrow. Catches late
    additions, alternates, and withdrawals.

  field_sync_d0       (daily at 11:00 UTC)
    Syncs the field for any tournament starting today. This is the critical
    run — tee times are confirmed by now, and locked picks depend on them.

  live_score_sync     (every 5 minutes, all days)
    Syncs live scores whenever a tournament is in_progress AND the current
    UTC time falls within the expected play window. The play window is
    derived from actual tee times stored in the DB (timezone-agnostic),
    with a wide conservative fallback if tee times haven't been loaded yet.

    Critically: there is NO day-of-week restriction. If a tournament is
    in_progress on Monday due to a weather delay or playoff carryover,
    live sync continues automatically.

    Also publishes TOURNAMENT_IN_PROGRESS SQS events while any linked
    playoff draft rounds remain unresolved (stops publishing once resolved).

  pick_reminder_send  (weekly Wednesday at 12:00 UTC)
    Creates PickReminder rows for all scheduled tournaments starting within
    the next 7 days, then immediately sends emails to approved league members
    who haven't picked yet and have pick_reminders_enabled = True. Leagues
    with no active season are silently skipped.

  results_finalization  (daily at 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC)
    Finds any completed tournament with unscored picks and runs score_picks().
    Runs three times per day so it catches any finish time on any day of the
    week — a Monday afternoon finish is caught by the 21:00 UTC run; a
    Tuesday finish is caught the next morning. Acts as a safety net if the
    SQS TOURNAMENT_COMPLETED pipeline missed anything.

Playoff automation (moved to SQS worker container)
----------------------------------------------------
  Playoff draft resolution and bracket advancement are handled by the SQS
  worker container (app/worker_main.py), not by APScheduler jobs:

    TOURNAMENT_IN_PROGRESS → resolve_draft() (when any R1 tee time passes)
    TOURNAMENT_COMPLETED   → score_picks() → score_round() → advance_bracket()

  This gives better timing (fires within seconds of the trigger event rather
  than polling every 5–10 minutes) and eliminates race conditions when running
  multiple scraper pods.

Why BackgroundScheduler (not AsyncIOScheduler)?
-----------------------------------------------
SQLAlchemy sessions and httpx calls are synchronous. Running them on the
asyncio event loop would block it. BackgroundScheduler runs each job in a
thread from its own thread pool, completely separate from asyncio — safe
and correct.

Play window algorithm
---------------------
For live_score_sync, "should we run now?" is computed as follows:

  1. Query tournament_entry_rounds for tee times where:
       - tournament_id = active in_progress tournament
       - date(tee_time) = today (UTC)
       - tee_time IS NOT NULL

  2a. If tee times exist:
        play_start = min(tee_times) - 30 min  (pre-round buffer)
        play_end   = max(tee_times) + 5 hours (generous finish buffer)
        → skip if current UTC time is outside [play_start, play_end]

  2b. If no tee times in DB yet (field not synced, or tee times unreleased):
        Use wide fallback: [10:00 UTC, 07:00 UTC next day]
        Covers US East (earliest tee ~10:30 UTC) through Hawaii (latest
        finish ~06:00 UTC). Wide enough for any PGA Tour location worldwide.
