"""
Scoring service.

Calculates season standings from picks stored in the database.

Scoring rules:
  - points_earned = golfer_earnings_usd * tournament.multiplier
  - If a user has no pick row for a completed tournament → league.no_pick_penalty is applied
  - Standings are sorted by total_points descending (highest wins)

Tie-breaking (applied in order when total_points are equal):
  1. Most picks submitted (higher pick_count wins — rewards consistent participation)
  2. Highest single-tournament score (best_week — rewards peak performance)
  3. Earliest league join date (joined_at ascending — stable, ungameable last resort)

This module contains pure calculation logic with no HTTP concerns. It can be
called from both the standings router and the scraper (when finalizing results).
