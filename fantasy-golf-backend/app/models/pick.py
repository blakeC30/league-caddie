"""
Pick model.

A Pick is the core action in the game: one league member chooses one golfer
for one tournament in a season. After the tournament ends, `points_earned`
is populated by the scoring service.

Business rules enforced here (via UniqueConstraint) and in the API layer:
  1. One pick per user per tournament per season per league.
     → UniqueConstraint on (league_id, season_id, user_id, tournament_id)
  2. No repeat golfers within a season for the same user in the same league.
     → Enforced in the picks service (not a simple DB constraint — requires
        a query to check existing picks for the season).
  3. Picks lock at tournament start_date.
     → Enforced in the API layer by comparing submitted_at to tournament.start_date.
