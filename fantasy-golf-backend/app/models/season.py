"""
Season model.

A Season represents a single competitive year within a league. Each league
runs one season per calendar year. Picks and standings are scoped to a season
— points don't carry over from one year to the next.

The UniqueConstraint ensures a league can't accidentally have two active
seasons for the same year.
